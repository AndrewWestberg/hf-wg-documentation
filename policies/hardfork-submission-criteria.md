# Mainnet Hardfork Initiation Governance Action Submission Criteria

Version: `0.1`

This policy describes specific metrics which the hardfork working group considers before recommending submission of a hardfork initiation governance action to mainnet.

This policy aims to apply to the most normal circumstances, special cases such as security upgrades may not necessarily apply.

### Context

We are in the brave new world, it is not this group deciding if Cardano is ready to hardfork.
This group can decide when we recommend submitting a hardfork initiation action - When do we think we are ready for SPOs and the ICC to consider a hardfork?
This group can also recommend key indicators we would like to see met before a hardfork, it is up to the SPOs and the ICC to make the decision to hardfork (and DReps for future forks).
We should consider that submitting a hardfork initiation action does not guarantee a hardfork
