# Mainnet Hardfork Initiation Governance Action Submission Criteria

Version: `0.1`

This policy describes specific metrics which the hardfork working group (HFWG) considers before recommending submission of a hardfork initiation governance action to Cardano mainnet.

This policy aims to apply to the most normal circumstances, special cases such as security upgrades may not necessarily apply.

### Context

- The hardfork working group **can not** decide if Cardano is ready to hardfork, this is up to the ICC, SPOs and DReps.
  - Historically, the working group could decide this, but we are now in the *brave new world*.
- The HFWG **can** decide when to recommend the submission of a hardfork initiation action - *When do we think we are ready for SPOs and the ICC to consider a hardfork?*
- The HFWG **can** recommend key indicators we would like to see met before a hardfork is ratified, these indicators can be forwarded to the voters for consideration.
- The decision to recommend the submission of a hardfork action must be ratified by the Technical Steering Committee.
- Submitting a hardfork does not guarantee the ratification and enactment of a hardfork.
